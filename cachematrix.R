##The functions bellow were created to cache the inverse of a matrix.


## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
##The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
##1-set the value of the vector
##2-get the value of the vector
##3-set the value of the mean
##4-get the value of the mean
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inversa) inv <<- inversa
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
}
